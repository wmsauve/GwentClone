# TODO
## Card Order
Move card order in hierarchy to render moused over card on top. Put card back in original order to move down to the "not moused over" position.
## Work on effects
Going to start working on the medic card effect or muster.

# Known Major Bugs
## Mulligan bug
Sometimes, when you scroll over and mulligan a card, it will throw invalid input to server error.
## Playing siege
Sometimes, After you start dragging a siege card, it wont be able to be dropped on the siege zone (probably need to pull camera back).
## Score not resetting when cards are destroyed.
Especially when scorch is used, the card will be removed, but server is not recalculating score correctly.
